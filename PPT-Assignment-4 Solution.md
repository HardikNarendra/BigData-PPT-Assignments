Assignment Questions 4
💡 Question 1 Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]<br>
Output: [1,5]<br>
Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.<br>

💡 Question 2  Given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return a list answer of size 2 where:<br>
•	answer[0] is a list of all distinct integers in nums1 which are not present in nums2*.*<br>
•	answer[1] is a list of all distinct integers in nums2 which are not present in nums1.<br>
Note that the integers in the lists may be returned in any order.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]<br>
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]<br>
Explanation:<br>
For nums1, nums1[1] = 2 is present at index 0 of nums2, whereas nums1[0] = 1 and nums1[2] = 3 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[0] = [1,3].<br>
For nums2, nums2[0] = 2 is present at index 1 of nums1, whereas nums2[1] = 4 and nums2[2] = 6 are not present in nums2. Therefore, answer[1] = [4,6].<br>

💡 Question 3 Given a 2D integer array matrix, return the transpose of matrix.<br>
The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]<br>
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]<br>

💡 Question 4 Given an integer array nums of 2n integers, group these integers into n pairs (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) such that the sum of min(ai, bi) for all i is maximized. Return the maximized sum.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [1,4,3,2]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: All possible pairings (ignoring the ordering of elements) are:<br>
1.	(1, 4), (2, 3) -> min(1, 4) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3<br>
2.	(1, 3), (2, 4) -> min(1, 3) + min(2, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3<br>
3.	(1, 2), (3, 4) -> min(1, 2) + min(3, 4) = 1 + 3 = 4<br>
So the maximum possible sum is 4.<br>

💡 Question 5 You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith  row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.<br>
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.<br>
Example 1:<br>
 ![alt text](https://github.com/HardikNarendra/BigData-PPT-Assignments/blob/main/images/ASSIGN-4-Q-5.jpg)
Input: n = 5<br>
Output: 2<br>
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.<br>

💡 Question 6 Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]<br>
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]<br>
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100]<br>

💡 Question 7 You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.<br>
Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations<br>
Example 1:<br>
 ![alt text](https://github.com/HardikNarendra/BigData-PPT-Assignments/blob/main/images/ASSIGN-4-Q-7.jpg)
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.<br>

💡 Question 8<br>
Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].<br>
Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].<br>
Example 1:<br>
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3<br>
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7]<br>
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].<br>
